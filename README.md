# Java Inheritance - Homework Tasks

## Introduction

To reinforce your understanding of the Java Inheritance concepts covered in our recent lecture, you are assigned the following homework tasks. Please complete them before our next session for review.

## Tasks

### 1. Method Overriding Practice

In this task, you are required to create a base class named `Shape`. This class should have a method named `area` that returns a double value. You must then extend this class into two child classes: `Circle` and `Square`. Both child classes should override the `area` method to accurately calculate the area of their respective shapes.

### 2. Polymorphism Implementation

For this task, create an array of `Shape` objects that includes instances of `Circle` and `Square` (from Task 1). Loop through this array and call the `area` method on each shape, printing the result to the console.

### 3. Abstract Class Exercise

Create an abstract class named `Appliance` with two abstract methods: `turnOn` and `turnOff`. Both methods should return nothing (void). Extend this abstract class to create two new classes: `WashingMachine` and `Refrigerator`. Implement both abstract methods (`turnOn` and `turnOff`) in these subclasses.

## Submission

Please ensure that you complete these tasks before our next session, as we will be reviewing them together.

Good luck!
